I feel that my body just like nature is waking up after a long winter. I am doing more stuff, feeling more energized. Want to spend more time outside.

I am trying to build that new morning routine, where I wake up and go for a short bike ride. Sit by the river and just relaxe before jumping into my workday. **So far this is working so well.** It is pumping me with good energy for the entire day.

I love good coffee in the morning, but recently have been trying to drink it a bit later in the day. At least one hour after after waking up. As one of my favourite scientist <a href="https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/using-caffeine-to-optimize-mental-and-physical-performance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Andrew Huberman suggests in his podcast.</a> It is a great listen. Highly reccomended!
