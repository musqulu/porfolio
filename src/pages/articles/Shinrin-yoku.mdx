I find taking care of your **well being** as important as taking care of your physical health, even though I often take it for granted.

Yesterday, I started reading a very short <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Your-Guide-Forest-Bathing-Expanded/dp/1590035135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book about Shinrin-yoku</a>, which is also called forest bathing. This practice involves spending time in a forest and focusing on the little things, such as the sound of leaves in the wind, buzzing bees, smelling flowers, etc. **It's so simple yet so powerful.** While enjoying my forest bath, I realized how stressed I was before doing it.

I'm so happy that spring is finally here. I will be spending much more time outside. I live in the beautiful Carpathian Mountains, which are full of wildlife, forests and rivers.

**Don't take your well-being for granted; work on it to be in good shape.**
