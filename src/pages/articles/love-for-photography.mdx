It's interesting how photography saves your point of view in time. When you are a person that picks up a camera and then goes out to shoot, it's exactly what you see, in some way.
Your perspective on life... On your life. We're so different from each other, and being able to see a different point of view is just an amazing, if you're willing to do that. 

Then when you're gone, these photos will stay. Your point of view. It's going to live when you are long gone. It's a beatiful thing. 

That is why I love photography.
