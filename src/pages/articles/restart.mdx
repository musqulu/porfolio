I made a lot of progress in so many areas of my life in the last couple of months, even when not being super consistent with my goals! 

Travelling and experiencing new places, meeting people, seeing things for yourself always gave me so much inspiration and new ideas. 

My recent trip to Japan was no different. It was a pretty big culture shock for me, but it gave me so much inspiration and enriched me creatively.
While travelling I've tried to take it slow, spend a week in place since I was still working full time. Next time I would take it even slower and spend 2-3 weeks in one place.

I've managed to cross one of the big "dreams" from my bucket list which was **swimming with Humpback whales, that was beafutiful!** To do it I've flew to Okinawa, Naha. Spent a week in there and managed to get on a boat twice.

This was a great idea since during the first time we've seen whales maybe for 20 seconds. But during our second try few days later we spot a calf with mother. They felt very comfortable, the boat was not crowded. **I got to look into calf eye, this opened something in me.** Something that I wasn't aware of. 

I've spent a month in Japan, came back home feeling enriched, willing to do more with my life. **Consume less and create more.**

So let me **restart** and let's ship something!
