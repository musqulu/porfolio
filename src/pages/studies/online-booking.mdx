I've been trying to be consistent with coding and taking walks. I have to goal to push at least one commit per day and do 10.000 steps. Now I have a new goal. Write an article, one per week. Share whatever happened with me, what inspired me. What pissed me off. 

  ## This is the beginning.

  I always aspired to become an indie hacker. Even when I had no idea about building digital products, I would just take a big piece of paper and start drawing UI and thinking about what it could be doing.

  Now, almost 10 years later, I do it for a living. That used to be my goal: get a good remote job and travel the world. Once I got there, the goal started to shift towards having more freedom and more money.

  I never felt like I would be able to work somewhere for longer, but all the experiences while working were so valuable to me and ultimately got me to where I am today.

  I am truly grateful for everything, literally everything, that has happened in my life!

  ## It has not always been easy nor nice.

  All the experiences I have had in my life have made me who I am today.

  All those stressful situations taught me something about myself that I did not know earlier.

  All the people I have met along the way have affected me in some way.

  It used to be hard, but I never gave up. I was always pushing. I had this weird feeling deep inside of me that it would get better, and the only thing I could do right then was to keep pushing.

  ## Mindfulness.

  One of the best things that helped me grow was meditation.

  I remember when, during my early twenties, I was backpacking around Southeast Asia and I had that piece of paper in my wallet with 100 things I wanted to do in my life. (I still do have that paper in my wallet.)

  One of those things was "live like a Buddhist monk." I had no idea what it meant, but I knew that these Buddhist monks had learned something that would help me.

  So, I ended up doing a Vipassana retreat in Thailand, in a place that was recommended to me by a girl at the bus station. That is another great story!

  That changed a lot of my life and gave me the understanding that we can achieve anything if we keep training our minds. Sounds cheesy, I know...

  ## I still have that feeling.

  I still feel that it will get better, or at least it can get better! Sometimes I might forget about my goals, but then I quickly get back to remembering them.

  Right now, what I want is to be consistent:

  1. With growth.
  2. With movement.
  3. With taking care of myself.
  4. With joy.

  This is an attempt to start doing things differently to get different results. Let's see how it will go.
